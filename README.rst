About the idea
--------------

We will build application, which will allow users to save and store bets with other friends (other users), group of users, etc. They'll be able to rate and comment bets, for winning a bet there will be points or prizes given out. Users will be able to register their new user account, or sign in with existing social profiles (facebook, google, twitter, ...). Bets will be sorted into different categories, for example sports, social, family, educational bets, users will be able to search bets for different keywords. On first page (home page) of application (not the user's home page!) we will display newest bets, most popular bets, statistics, etc. User will be able to bet against single user, a group of users and also groups of users will be able to bet against other groups. Bets will be either private or public.
